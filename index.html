        <p>I am Josue Mendoza, I am 21 year old. I really like to play ukulele and sing. I am very excited to have this
            new page. I'm studying in BYU Idaho through Byu Pathway, and this is a very good oportunity that I have to
            grow. Something that I really love to do is to spend time with my friends and my family, specially with my
            family. I love to live the gospel of Jesuschrist because even when I have bad days, I can find peace and
            happiness. I want to learn a lot of new things to be more like my savior is.</p>

        <p>My country is very beautiful. It has a great culture. Also, it has a variety of food that can make someone
            feel welcome. I really like the many tourist places that you can find here. Also, the people here is very
            nice, for example, everyone greet you when you greet them.</p>
