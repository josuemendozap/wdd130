                <p>Hi! My experience was ht ebest experience in my life since I was 30 years old, now I'm 31 hahaha!
                    It's a joke, I'm 50 years old. I took the trip "El rapido del Diablo", and it was so exciting! I was
                    so nervious at the beggining, but the equipament helped me to feel a little bit more protected. I
                    have to say that the equipament is very safe because before the trip I saw how the personal was
                    verifying that everything was in order. - John Thomas</p>

                <p>Hello there! My name is Sam. I came here to have a good time with my family. But instead of that I
                    had an excellent time with them. The trip that we took was "The Snake Path". And I can say that
                    everything was beautiful. I felt how my family got united. I was afraid because of my children, they
                    are 6 and 8 years old. But the personal and the equipament helped me to feel calmer. The adventure
                    makes it worth the price! - Sam Carter</p>

            <p>Hi my friends! I took the "Between Rocks" adventure. I came here with my wife. She enjoyed it a lot! And
                if she is happy, me too. All the personal was very kind and all the time was paying attention to any
                concern about the trip that we had hahaha. The place is beautiful and has a lot of activities for any
                age, I really liked that. - Randy Lund</p>
